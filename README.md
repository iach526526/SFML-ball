# Ball Animation with SFML

## Introduction

This project showcases an interactive animation of moving balls with trails using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). The animation includes customizable parameters such as ball colors, background colors, and trail settings. The balls move around the screen, and trails are drawn behind them based on their movement.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) library installed.
- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later.

### Building the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Compile the code:**
   Use your preferred build system (e.g., CMake, Makefile) to compile the project. Ensure SFML is properly linked.

### Running the Program

After building the project, execute the compiled binary to start the animation. The program will display a window with animated balls and trails.
